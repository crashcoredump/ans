Doesn't check a zone file for inconsistent information (a 'CNAME'
record along w/ any other info, records that aren't in that zone, etc)

Doesn't round-robin or randomize results (nameserver is randomized in
some cases, actually).

Need to handle dynamic updates [RFC2136]

IXFR support? [RFC1995]

When saving out zone files, save them in breadth first order.
Or.. save the data in a lispy format.

Need checks to make sure the configuration file doesn't try to make
the server master AND slave for the same domain.

Might need to fix add-or-update-srv-record.  I'm not sure what to
compare against to determine whether an add or an update is happening.

Memory consumption seems high.

Should keep track of a request that's currently being processed and
drop or queue any subsequent requests for the same information.

BIND does a NS lookup of '.' right when it starts up.  ans should do
that as well.

Need to do the right thing w/ the recursion-desired query bit.  If
recursion is not desired, we should avoid recursion.

tcp client connections should be dropped after a period of inactivity.
