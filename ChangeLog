	* ans.cl:

	Many changes to help w/ case mode issues.

	Attempts to prevent cache poisoning.

2001-10-11  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* Added *verbose* parameter to control noise.  Changed
	tcp-client-handler so that it doesn't treat end-of-file as an
	error.  Commented out some debugging messages in various places.
	Fixed file descriptor leak in transfer-zone by using an
	unwind-protect.

	* ans.cl: 

	Added 'forever' keyword arg to 'main' function to control whether
	or not the main function loops forever.

	Changed add-or-update-{a,ns,mx} to use if* for clarity.

	Removed a syntax error near add-or-update-mx that was screwing
	things up.

	Moved the defstruct expectedresponse to before its first use.

	* added config.cl.sample file.  updated BUGS file.

2001-08-02  root  <root@dancy>

	* ans.cl: Updated code for doing secondary nameserver work.
	Refreshes, retries and expires should work now [not really tested,
	however]

	Now using a resource for the output message buffer.  This should
	save some memory allocation overhead.
	
	locate-node now only returns valid nodes.  
	
	new function locate-nearest-valid-node for use by locate-node.
	
	Fixed a bug where the *nextid* would grow larger than a 16-bit
	number.  Now it wraps around to 1.

	invalidate-node now marks a the node as non-authoritative as well
	(so that, hopefully, we don't answer queries for expired
	authoritative domains).  I'll probably have to add some code to
	make sure that the nameserver never tries to query itself for zone
	data.  It could cause a loop.

	
2001-07-19  root  <root@dancy>

	* Added a *minimumttl* parameter.  Any TTLs we get back from
	nameservers that are smaller than *minimumttl* will be bumped up
	to *minimumttl*.  This is to prevent RRs with small TTLs (such as
	a TTL of 0) from being erased from the cache before they can be
	returned to the query client.

	Adjusted extract-RRs func to use *minimumttl*.

	Changed (dumpdb) so that you can choose the starting node.

2001-07-17  root  <root@dancy>

	* Fixed bug w/ the tcp client handling stuff.  Need to accept
	the connection before doing mp:process-run-function... otherwise
	there's a race condition that makes the program continually create
	new tcp client handlers until the original one completed its
	accept-connection (because the listener socket would still be
	ready up until that point).

	* Changed the order that RRs are dumped during an AXFR.

	* Keep the main and expire loop processes in variables for easy
	kill.   Make the (main) function kill old processes before
	starting new ones.

	* Added hacks to make the expire look sleep interruptible in case
	a nearer-term TTL item has just been added to the cache.a
	
2001-07-16  root  <root@dancy>

	* Way-simplified the tcp client handling stuff.

	* Wrapped a general handler around the message handler.  When an
	error occurs, the message receivd will be hexdumped for perusal.

	* Added a coupla optimization statements here and there.

	* Added some alists to map from type symbols to reader and writer
	functions.

	* Modified the expired-p function to be more efficient (that's a
	time argument now instead of calling get-universal-time over and
	over).  In fact, adjusted several things in the record expiration
	code to make it a bit more efficient.   Still could use a way to
	wake a sleeping process.

	* No longer set the *RD* bit on queries to other nameservers.
	Some of them won't return any answer at all (just an error
	RCODE) if *RD* is set.  We don't need *RD* to be set so it's all
	good.  [I've only encountered one nameserver that has behaved this way].

	

2001-07-12  root  <root@dancy>

	* ans.cl: Added support for SRV resource records.    
	Fixed *opcodeshift* (it was -12 when it should have been -11).  
	Handles NOTIFY requests now. 
	Added a keyword to put-name and its helpers to turn off
	compression.
	Bind *print-pretty* to 'nil' for the expire-records process.
	Tried a different approach to avoid nameserver lookup infinite
	recursion.
	Added initial support for working as a secondary nameserver.
	
	

2001-07-06  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* Rearranged some code in ans.cl.  Added support for ANY (*) query type.

	* Added ChangeLog
